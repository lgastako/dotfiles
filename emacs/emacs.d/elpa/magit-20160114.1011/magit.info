This is magit.info, produced by makeinfo version 5.2 from magit.texi.

Magit is an interface to the version control system Git, implemented as
an Emacs package.  Magit aspires to be a complete Git porcelain.  While
we cannot (yet) claim that Magit wraps and improves upon each and every
Git command, it is complete enough to allow even experienced Git users
to perform almost all of their daily version control tasks directly from
within Emacs.  While many fine Git clients exist, only Magit and Git
itself deserve to be called porcelains.
