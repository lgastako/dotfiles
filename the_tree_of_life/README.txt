This is a drug induced attempt to make managing my environment across all of
the different platforms I work a little easier.

The idea is basically that I maintain nice tight sqlite schema of information
about what kinds of things I want installed where and then include in the
database whatever information is necessary for installing and configuring
each thing on each platform.

The first two examples of "things" are packages and virtualenvs.
