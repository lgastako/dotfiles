;;; Commentary:
;;
;;    Extensions to `htmlize.el' (Hrvoje Niksic, hniksic@xemacs.org).
;;
;; Hrvoje Niksic's `htmlize.el' creates HTML files from fontified
;; buffers, but it does not attempt to create any HTML links.  Library
;; `mkhtml.el' extends `htmlize.el' by trying to do that in a couple
;; of specific cases, interpreting mouse-face'd text in Info and Dired
;; buffers as links.  A version of `htmlize.el' named
;; `mkhtml-htmlize.el' is provided with the MKHTML package.  Use that.
;;
;; Recent versions of `htmlize.el' do not work with `mkhtml.el' - I
;; just have not had a chance to update `mkhtml.el'.  For use other
;; than with `mkhtml.el', you can get the latest version of
;; `htmlize.el' from Niksic's web site at
;; `http://fly.srk.fer.hr/~hniksic/emacs/htmlize.el', or perhaps by
;; email (hniksic@xemacs.org).
;;
;; Somewhat related functionality to that of `mkhtml.el' is available
;; with `info2www'.  This is a shell script that converts Emacs Info
;; files on the fly to HTML.  See
;; `http://www-flash.stanford.edu/info2www/info2www.html'.
;;
;; See also the `makeinfo' utility (Note: texi2html is now obsolete,
;; replaced by Makeinfo).  Like mkhtml, makeinfo can convert entire
;; Info files to HTML.  The result of converting an Info file with
;; makeinfo is a single HTML file.  The result of converting an Info
;; file with `mkhtml-file' is an HTML file for each node in the Info
;; file.  To produce a single HTML file with multiple Info nodes using
;; mkhtml, you need to first merge the nodes with the command
;; `Info-merge-subnodes' (see file `info+.el').
;;
;; -------------------------------------------------------------------
;; Main new functions defined here:
;;
;;    `mkhtml-any-buffer', `mkhtml-convert-std-filename',
;;    `mkhtml-dired', `mkhtml-dired-files', `mkhtml-dired-link-fn',
;;    `mkhtml-file', `mkhtml-file-menu-item', `mkhtml-files',
;;    `mkhtml-get-basefont-size', `mkhtml-get-css-font-size',
;;    `mkhtml-get-font-family', `mkhtml-info-buffer',
;;    `mkhtml-info-link-fn', `mkhtml-insert-header',
;;    `mkhtml-make-HTML-file-name', `mkhtml-merged-info-buffer',
;;    `mkhtml-merged-info-link-fn', `mkhtml-non-file-menu-item',
;;    `mkhtml-particular-buffer', `mkhtml-plain-buffer',
;;    `mkhtml-plain-link-fn', `mkhtml-save-buffer'.
;;
;; New user options (variables) defined here:
;;
;;    `mkhtml-dir-sep-replacement', `mkhtml-file-node-sep',
;;    `mkhtml-font-size', `mkhtml-hover-link-bg-color',
;;    `mkhtml-hover-link-fg-color', `mkhtml-link-color',
;;    `mkhtml-preserve-fonts', `mkhtml-visited-link-color'.
;;
;; Other variable defined here: `mkhtml-version'.
;;
;;
;;  ***** NOTE: The following functions defined in `htmlize.el' have
;;              been REDEFINED HERE:
;;
;;  `htmlize-css-specs' - Adds font-family and font-size too.
;;  `htmlize-css-insert-head' - Adds link color too.
;;  `htmlize-font-body-tag' - Adds  BASEFONT size too.
;; -------------------------------------------------------------------
;;
;;
;; COMMANDS
;;
;; The main commands defined here are `mkhtml-any-buffer',
;; `mkhtml-dired-files' and `mkhtml-file'.  These all try to analyze
;; the context (Dired, Info, merged Info) of the buffer or file(s) to
;; determine how to create appropriate HTML links.  The most powerful
;; of the commands here is `mkhtml-any-buffer'.
;;
;; If you know the context, you can alternatively use directly one of
;; the individual commands `mkhtml-dired', `mkhtml-info-buffer',
;; `mkhtml-merged-info-buffer', or `mkhtml-plain-buffer'.  Each of
;; these uses the generic function `mkhtml-particular-buffer'.  You
;; can also use `mkhtml-particular-buffer' to create your own function
;; for creating HTML links in another special context.
;;
;; Loading this file adds to the `Info' menu-bar menu (in Info mode).
;;
;;
;; RELATED FILES
;;
;; The MKHTML package contains these files:
;;
;; `frame-cmds.el': frame and window commands (interactive functions)
;;    (uses `frame-fns.el', `icomplete+.el', `strings.el')
;; `frame-fns.el': non-interactive frame and window functions
;; `htmlize.el': create HTML from font-lock'd buffers
;; `icomplete+.el': extends GNU `icomplete.el'
;; `info+.el': extends GNU `info.el'
;;    (uses `fit-frame.el', `strings.el', `thingatpt+.el')
;; `misc-fns.el': miscellaneous non-interactive functions
;; `mkhtml.el' (this file): extends `htmlize.el' to treat hyperlinks
;; `fit-frame.el': fits frames to their selected window
;;    (uses `misc-fns.el', `strings.el')
;; `strings.el': miscellaneous string functions
;;    (uses `thingatpt+.el')
;; `thingatpt+.el' - extends GNU `thingatpt.el'
;;
;; All of these are loaded automatically, when you load `mkhtml.el'.
;; The best way to do that is by adding this to your `~/.emacs' file:
;;
;;     (require 'mkhtml)
;;
;; Only `mkhtml-htmlize.el' is strictly required by `mkhtml.el', but
;; `info+.el' is also needed if you want to take advantage of certain
;; functionalities in `mkhtml.el' (see next paragraph).  The other
;; files in this package are not strictly required, but they let you
;; take best advantage of `info+.el'.
;;
;; Commands `mkhtml-merged-info-buffer' and `mkhtml-any-buffer',
;; defined here, are able to convert merged Info buffers, which are
;; created by command `Info-merge-subnodes' (see file `info+.el').  A
;; merged Info buffer contains a merge of an Info node with all of its
;; subnodes (perhaps recursively).  This can be useful for creating
;; larger HTML files containing several nodes (otherwise, a separate
;; HTML file is created for each node).
;;
;; File `setup-info.el' can be useful if you want to make HTML
;; versions of large Info indexes such as the Emacs manual Key Index.
;; By default, large index menus are not highlighted in Info, so no
;; HTML links are created for them.  File `setup-info.el' allows for
;; highlighting larger menus by increasing variable
;; `Info-fontify-maximum-menu-size' to 100000.  It also redefines the
;; faces in `Info-title-face-alist'.
;;
;;
;;  The following binding is made here:
;;
;;    menu bar Tools menu        `mkhtml-any-buffer'
;;
;;  The following bindings are made here for Info mode
;;  (these commands are also added to the Info menu-bar menu):
;;
;;    `c'                        `mkhtml-info-buffer'
;;    `w'                        `mkhtml-file'
;;
;;  The command `mkhtml-merged-info-buffer' is added to the Info
;;  menu-bar menu for merged Info buffers.
;;
;;
;;
;;
;;
;; CURRENT LIMITATIONS / POSSIBLE IMPROVEMENTS:
;;
;;   1. Perhaps it would be better to use relative paths, not absolute?
;;      Or to make it a user choice?
;;   2. No attempt has been made to support other than GNU Emacs
;;      (e.g. XEmacs).
;;   3. There is no treatment yet of file names in `Note:' (Info cross
;;      references).  For example, `Note: (emacs) Minibuffer::' =>
;;      a link to "#(emacs) Minibuffer" (merged Info buffer) or to
;;      "(emacs) Minibuffer.html" (normal Info buffer).
;;   4. Not yet taking into account `Note: xxx: yyy' (as opposed to
;;      `Note: xxx:: yyy').  Currently this links to xxx, not yyy.
;;   5. For a merged info buffer, there is no way of knowing if a link
;;      is to elsewhere in the same buffer or not.  Most such links
;;      are menu items, so they will point to places in the same
;;      buffer.  But cross refs (`Note:') may point beyond the buffer.
;;      Those are not treated differently here - all links are
;;      currently made to point to hashes (#) in the same HTML file
;;      derived from the same buffer.

;;; Change Log:
;;
;; 2007/01/19 dadams

;;        mkhtml-hover-link-bg-color, mkhtml-hover-link-fg-color,
;;        mkhtml-link-color, mkhtml-visited-link-color.
;;     2. Use mkhtml-insert-header in: mkhtml-any-buffer, mkhtml-particular-buffer
;; 2000/11/15 dadams
;;     Version 1.3: Bug fix -

Info buffers are treated as by `mkhtml-info-buffer'.

Merged Info buffers are treated as by `mkhtml-merged-info-buffer'.
A merged Info buffer is one created by `Info-merge-subnodes' (defined
in file `info+.el'), which is a merge of an Info node with all of
its subnodes.

Other buffers are treated as by `mkhtml-plain-buffer': Note that HTML
links resulting from mouse-face'd text there are likely to point
nowhere.

\(Note: Buffers with no mouse-face'd text are treated as by
`htmlize-buffer'.)"

Save merged Info BUFFER as a new HTML file in directory HTML-DIR.
A merged Info buffer is one created via `Info-merge-subnodes',
which is defined in file `info+.el'.

Text with `mouse-face' property is converted to HTML links.
The HTML file is named after the buffer.

The HTML file is named after the buffer's top node.  Whenever it
contains illegal filename characters it is altered:
  1) `directory-sep-char' is replaced by `mkhtml-dir-sep-replacement'.
  2) `mkhtml-convert-std-filename' is used to replace other chars.

Note: For a merged Info buffer, there is no way of knowing if a link
      is to somewhere in the same buffer or not.  Most such links are
      menu items, so they will point to places in the same buffer.
      But cross refs (`Note:') may point beyond the buffer.  We don't
      treat cross refs differently here - instead, all links are made
      to point to hashes (#) in the same HTML file derived from the
