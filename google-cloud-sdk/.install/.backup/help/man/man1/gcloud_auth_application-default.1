.SH "SYNOPSIS"

\f5gcloud auth application\-default\fR \fICOMMAND\fR [\fIGLOBAL\-FLAG\ ...\fR]



.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Application Default Credentials provide a simple way to get authorization
credentials for use in calling Google APIs. These commands assist in managing
the active credentials on your machine that are used for testing purposes during
local application development.

These credentials are strictly used by Google client libraries in your own
application. They are not used for any API calls made by the \f5gcloud\fR CLI,
nor do they have any interaction with the credentials acquired by \f5gcloud auth
login\fR.

For more information on ADC and how they work, see:
