  fundamental-mode "Fuzzy Completions"
  "Major mode for presenting fuzzy completion results.

When you run `sly-fuzzy-complete-symbol', the symbol token at
point is completed using the Fuzzy Completion algorithm; this
means that the token is taken as a sequence of characters and all
the various possibilities that this sequence could meaningfully
represent are offered as selectable choices, sorted by how well
they deem to be a match for the token. (For instance, the first
choice of completing on \"mvb\" would be \"multiple-value-bind\".)

Therefore, a new buffer (*Fuzzy Completions*) will pop up that
contains the different completion choices. Simultaneously, a
special minor-mode will be temporarily enabled in the original
buffer where you initiated fuzzy completion (also called the
``target buffer'') in order to navigate through the *Fuzzy
Completions* buffer without leaving.

With focus in *Fuzzy Completions*:
  Type `n' and `p' (`UP', `DOWN') to navigate between completions.
  Type `RET' or `TAB' to select the completion near point.
  Type `q' to abort.

With focus in the target buffer:
  Type `UP' and `DOWN' to navigate between completions.
  Type a character that does not constitute a symbol name
  to insert the current choice and then that character (`(', `)',
  `SPACE', `RET'.) Use `TAB' to simply insert the current choice.
  Use C-g to abort.

Alternatively, you can click <mouse-2> on a completion to select it.
