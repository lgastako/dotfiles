# dotfiles

![Perhaps everything is an illusion](http://i.imgur.com/NYekVDw.png)

These are just my dotfiles.  Started using git for them on 3/13/2010.  We'll
see how this goes.

Update: 4/2/2012... It's going awesome.  Wish I had more time to get them just
so, but it's still going awesome.

Update: 11/8/2015.  Going to start cleaning things up a bit. Starting with
collecting a list of issues and trying to find solutions for them.

KNOWN ISSUES:

- M-p in emacs should jump to previous test in clj/cljs files (via cider) but
  it isn't bound
